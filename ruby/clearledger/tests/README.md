# ClearLedger Tests

- `unit/`: deterministic ledger, routing, policy, queue, SLA, and statistics tests
- `integration/`: replay chaos, fault injection, and cross-domain orchestration tests
- `services/`: service contract/interface integrity checks

This suite intentionally mixes boundary, stale-replay, and policy-guard edge cases.
